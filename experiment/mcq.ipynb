      "{'text': \"\\nMachine Learning, often abbreviated as ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. In simpler terms, machine learning enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\\n\\nAt its core, machine learning is all about creating and implementing algorithms that facilitate these decisions and predictions. These algorithms are designed to improve their performance over time, becoming more accurate and effective as they process more data.\\n\\nIn traditional programming, a computer follows a set of predefined instructions to perform a task. However, in machine learning, the computer is given a set of examples (data) and a task to perform, but it's up to the computer to figure out how to accomplish the task based on the examples it's given.\\n\\nFor instance, if we want a computer to recognize images of cats, we don't provide it with specific instructions on what a cat looks like. Instead, we give it thousands of images of cats and let the machine learning algorithm figure out the common patterns and features that define a cat. Over time, as the algorithm processes more images, it gets better at recognizing cats, even when presented with images it has never seen before.\\n\\nThis ability to learn from data and improve over time makes machine learning incredibly powerful and versatile. It's the driving force behind many of the technological advancements we see today, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to self-driving cars and predictive analytics.\\n\\nMachine learning vs AI vs deep learning\\nMachine learning is often confused with artificial intelligence or deep learning.
